<!--
Use this template as a quick starting point when writing a README for your Pulumi example. To start, copy this file to your example folder and rename it to `README.md`. Once you've reviewed the template, delete the comments and begin writing your accompanying README for your example Pulumi application.

Use GitHub's "Preview Changes" functionality to make sure everything is formatted correctly in Markdown.

Readers should be able to follow your example from beginning to end. Please be sure to list all prerequisites, and test your guide from start to finish. Cut and paste commands from the README into your terminal to make sure there aren't typos or inaccuracies. If you find yourself executing a command that isn't in the README, make sure to add it so the readers end up with a complete tutorial. See [EC2 Linux WebServer Instance](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/tutorials/aws/ec2-webserver/) for an example of a tutorial following this template. Note that the featured tutorial is multi-language whereas the exampleas in this repo are cloud and language-specific (except for the ones with the `cloud` prefix).

## Deploy the App

### Step 1: Create a directory and cd into it

For Pulumi examples, we typically start by creating a directory and changing into it. Then, we create a new Pulumi project from a template. For example, `azure-javascript`.

If showing a command, explain the command first by talking about what it does. Then show the command and its output. If the output is too long, you can clip it with `...` and only show the relevant parts. If your README includes images, make sure to include an alt text.

Now transition to the next step by telling the reader what's next. If you're adding to a file, make sure to clearly explain that.
