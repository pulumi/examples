We can see here in the `---outputs:---` section that Wordpress was allocated a Cluster IP, in this
case `10.96.224.4`. It is exported with a stack output variable, `frontendIp`. Since this is a Cluster IP, you will need to port-forward to the service in order to hit the endpoint at `http://localhost:8080`
by running the port-forward command specified in `portForwardCommand`.

You can navigate to the site in a web browser.

When you're done, you can remove these resources with `pulumi destroy`:

```sh
pulumi destroy --skip-preview

The resources in the stack have been deleted, but the history and configuration associated with the stack are still maintained.
