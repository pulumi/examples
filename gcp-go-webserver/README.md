# Web Server Using Compute Engine

Starting point for building the Pulumi web server sample in Google Cloud.

## Running the App

1.  Create a new stack:

    ```
    $ pulumi stack init webserver-gcp-testing
    ```

1.  Configure the project:

    ```
    $ pulumi config set gcp:project YOURGOOGLECLOUDPROJECT
    $ pulumi config set gcp:zone us-central1-a
    ```

1.  Restore NPM dependencies:

    ```
    $ npm install
    ```

1.  Run `pulumi up` to preview and deploy changes:

    ``` 
    $ pulumi up
    Previewing changes:
    ...

    Performing changes:

        Type                     Name                                 Status      Info
    +   pulumi:pulumi:Stack      webserver-gcp-webserver-gcp-testing  created
    +   ├─ gcp:compute:Network   network                              created
    +   ├─ gcp:compute:Firewall  firewall                             created
    +   └─ gcp:compute:Instance  instance                             created

    ---outputs:---
    instanceIP  : "35.185.200.158"
    instanceName: "instance-af7e53b"

    info: 4 changes performed:
        + 4 resources created
    Update duration: 1m23s
    ```

1.  Curl the HTTP server:

    ```
    $ curl $(pulumi stack output instanceIP)
    Hello, World!
    ```

1.  SSH into the server:

    ```
    $ gcloud compute ssh $(pulumi stack output instanceName)
