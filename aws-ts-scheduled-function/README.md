# Scheduled Function on AWS

A simple function in AWS that executes based on a schedule using CloudWatch.

In this example, an S3 Bucket will be created. A function will run every Friday at 11:00pm UTC
that will delete all of the objects it contains.

## Deploying and running the program

1.  Create a new stack:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi stack init dev
    ```

1.  Set the AWS region:

    ```
    $ pulumi config set aws:region us-east-1
    ```

1.  Restore NPM modules via `npm install` or `yarn install`.

1.  Run `pulumi up` to preview and deploy changes:

    ```
    $ pulumi up
    Previewing update of stack 'dev'
    ...

    Updating (dev):

        Type                                          Name                           Status
    +   pulumi:pulumi:Stack                           aws-ts-scheduled-function-dev  created
    +   ├─ aws:cloudwatch:EventRuleEventSubscription  emptyTrash                     created
    +   │  ├─ aws:cloudwatch:EventRule                emptyTrash                     created
    +   │  ├─ aws:iam:Role                            emptyTrash                     created
    +   │  ├─ aws:iam:RolePolicyAttachment            emptyTrash-32be53a2            created
    +   │  ├─ aws:lambda:Function                     emptyTrash                     created
    +   │  ├─ aws:cloudwatch:EventTarget              emptyTrash                     created
    +   │  └─ aws:lambda:Permission                   emptyTrash                     created
    +   └─ aws:s3:Bucket                              trash                          created

    Outputs:
        bucketName: "trash-28693b6"

    Resources:
        + 9 created

    Duration: 16s
    ```

## Clean up

1.  Run `pulumi destroy` to tear down all resources.

1.  To delete the stack itself, run `pulumi stack rm`. Note that this command deletes all deployment history from the Pulumi Console.
