# Static Website Using Azure Blob Storage and CDN

This example configures [Static website hosting in Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website).

In addition to the Storage itself, a CDN is configured to serve files from the Blob container origin. This may be useful if you need to serve files via HTTPS from a custom domain (not shown in the example).

## Running the App

1.  Create a new stack:

    ```
    $ pulumi stack init dev
    ```

1.  Login to Azure CLI (you will be prompted to do this during deployment if you forget this step):

    ```
    $ az login
    ```

1.  Set the Azure region location to use:

    ```
    $ pulumi config set azure-native:location westus
    ```

1.  Run `pulumi up` to preview and deploy changes:

    ``` 
    $ pulumi up
    Previewing changes:
    ...

    Performing changes:
    ...
    Resources:
        + 9 created
    Duration: 2m52s
    ```

1.  Check the deployed website endpoint:

    ```
    $ pulumi stack output staticEndpoint
    https://websitesbc90978a1.z20.web.core.windows.net/
    $ curl "$(pulumi stack output staticEndpoint)"
