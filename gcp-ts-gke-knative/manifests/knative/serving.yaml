    # If set to "*" Istio will intercept all traffic within
    # the cluster as well as traffic that is going outside the cluster.
    # Traffic going outside the cluster will be blocked unless
    # necessary egress rules are created.
    #
    # If omitted or set to "", value of global.proxy.includeIPRanges
    # provided at Istio deployment time is used. In default Knative serving
    # deployment, global.proxy.includeIPRanges value is set to "*".
    #
    # If an invalid value is passed, "" is used instead.
    #
    # If valid set of IP address ranges are put into this value,
    # Istio will no longer intercept traffic going to IP addresses
    # outside the provided ranges and there is no need to specify
    # egress rules.
    #
    # To determine the IP ranges of your cluster:
    #   IBM Cloud Private: cat cluster/config.yaml | grep service_cluster_ip_range
    #   IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service: "172.30.0.0/16,172.20.0.0/16,10.10.10.0/24"
    #   Google Container Engine (GKE): gcloud container clusters describe XXXXXXX --zone=XXXXXX | grep -e clusterIpv4Cidr -e servicesIpv4Cidr
    #   Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS): "10.0.0.0/16"
    #   Azure Container Service (ACS; deprecated): "10.244.0.0/16,10.240.0.0/16"
