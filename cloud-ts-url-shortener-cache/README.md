# Serverless URL Shortener with Redis Cache

A sample URL shortener SPA that uses the high-level `cloud.Table` and `cloud.API` components. The example shows to combine serverless functions along with containers. This shows that you can create your own `cloud.*`-like
abstractions for your own use, your team's, or to share with the community using your language's package manager.

## Deploying and running the program

Note: some values in this example will be different from run to run.  These values are indicated
with `***`.

1. Create a new stack:

    ```
    $ pulumi stack init url-cache-testing
    ```

1.  Set AWS as the provider:

    ```
    $ pulumi config set cloud:provider aws
    ```

1.  Configure Pulumi to use AWS Fargate, which is currently only available in `us-east-1`, `us-east-2`, `us-west-2`, and `eu-west-1`:

    ```
    $ pulumi config set aws:region us-west-2
    $ pulumi config set cloud-aws:useFargate true
    ```

1. Set a value for the Redis password. The value can be an encrypted secret, specified with the `--secret` flag. If this flag is not provided, the value will be saved as plaintext in `Pulumi.url-cache-testing.yaml` (since `url-cache-testing` is the current stack name).

    ```
    $ pulumi config set --secret redisPassword S3cr37Password
    ```

1. Restore NPM modules via `npm install` or `yarn install`.

1. Preview and run the deployment via `pulumi up`. The operation will take about 5 minutes to complete.

    ```
    $ pulumi up
    Previewing stack 'url-cache-testing'
    ...

    Updating stack 'url-cache-testing'
    Performing changes:

    #:  Resource Type                            Name
    1:  pulumi:pulumi:Stack                      url-shortener-cache-url-
    ...
    49: aws:apigateway:Stage                     urlshortener

    info: 49 changes performed:
        + 49 resources created
    Update duration: ***
    ```

1. To view the API endpoint, use the `stack output` command:

    ```
    $ pulumi stack output endpointUrl
    https://***.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/stage/
    ```

1. Open this page in a browser and you'll see a single page app for creating and viewing short URLs.

## Clean up

To clean up resources, run `pulumi destroy` and answer the confirmation question at the prompt.
