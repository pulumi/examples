# Serverless URL Shortener with Redis Cache

A sample URL shortener SPA that uses the high-level `cloud.Table` and `cloud.HttpEndpoint` components. The example shows to combine serverless functions along with containers.

## Deploying and running the program

1. Create a new stack:

    ```
    $ pulumi stack init url-cache-testing
    ```

1.  Set AWS as the provider:

    ```
    $ pulumi config set cloud:provider aws
    ```

1.  Configure Pulumi to use AWS Fargate, which is currently only available in `us-east-1`, `us-east-2`, `us-west-2`, and `eu-west-1`:

    ```
    $ pulumi config set aws:region us-west-2
    $ pulumi config set cloud-aws:useFargate true
    ```    

1. Set a value for the Redis password. The value can be an encrypted secret, specified with the `--secret` flag. If this flag is not provided, the value will be saved as plaintext in `Pulumi.url-cache-testing.yaml` (since `url-cache-testing` is the current stack name).

    ```
    $ pulumi config set --secret redisPassword S3cr37Password
    ```

1. Restore NPM modules via `npm install`.

1. Compile the program via `tsc` or `npm run build`.

1. Preview and run the deployment via `pulumi update`. The operation will take about 5 minutes to complete.

    ```
    $ pulumi update
    Previewing stack 'url-cache-testing'
    ...

    Updating stack 'url-cache-testing'
    Performing changes:

    #:  Resource Type                            Name                    
    1:  pulumi:pulumi:Stack                      url-shortener-cache-url-
    ...
    63: aws:apigateway:Stage                     urlshortener            
    
    info: 63 changes performed:
        + 63 resources created
    Update duration: 5m48.727390626s
    ```

1. To view the API endpoint, use the `stack output` command:

    ```
    $ pulumi stack output endpointUrl
    https://gs8t66u634.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/stage/
    ```

1. Open this page in a browser and you'll see a single page app for creating and viewing short URLs.

1.  To clean up resources, run `pulumi destroy` and answer the confirmation question at the prompt.
