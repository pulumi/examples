# Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) App Using CosmosDB

Stands up an [Azure Kubernetes Service][aks] (AKS) cluster and a MongoDB-flavored instance of
[CosmosDB][cosmos]. On top of the AKS cluster, we also deploy [Helm][helm] Chart with a simple
Node.js TODO app ([`bitnami/node`][sample-mean]), swapping out the usual in-cluster MongoDB instance
with our managed CosmosDB instance.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have [downloaded and installed the Pulumi CLI](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/).

We will be deploying to Azure, so you will need an Azure account. If you don't have an account,
[sign up for free here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/). [Follow the instructions
here](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/cloud-providers/azure/setup/) to connect Pulumi to your Azure account.

This example deploys a Helm Chart from [Bitnami's Helm chart repository](https://github.com/bitnami/charts)

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

## Running the App

1. Create a new stack:

    ```sh
    $ pulumi stack init
    Enter a stack name: azure-mean
    ```

1. Set the required configuration variables for this program:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi config set azure:environment public
    $ pulumi config set password --secret [your-cluster-password-here]
    $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -f key.rsa
    $ pulumi config set sshPublicKey < key.rsa.pub
    $ az login
    ```

1. Perform the deployment:

    > **Note**: Due to an [issue](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-azuread/issues/156) in Azure Terraform Provider, the
    > creation of an Azure Service Principal, which is needed to create the Kubernetes cluster (see cluster.ts), is delayed and may not
    > be available when the cluster is created.  If you get a "Service Principal not found" error, as a work around, you should be able to run `pulumi up`
    > again, at which time the Service Principal replication should have been completed. See [this issue](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/1206) and
    > [this doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/troubleshooting#im-receiving-errors-that-my-service-principal-was-not-found-when-i-try-to-create-a-new-cluster-without-passing-in-an-existing-one)
    > for further details.

    $ pulumi up

    ```

    We can see here in the `---outputs:---` section that our Node.js appwas allocated a public IP,
    in this case `40.76.25.71`. It is exported with a stack output variable, `frontendAddress`. We
    can use `curl` and `grep` to retrieve the `<title>` of the site the proxy points at.

    ```sh
    $ curl -sL $(pulumi stack output frontendAddress) | grep "<title>"
        <title>Node/Angular Todo App</title>>
    ```

## Next steps

One of the interesting aspects of this example is the way it demonstrates how easy it is to use
Azure resources to configure Kubernetes resources, without the need for intermediate APIs such as
[OSBA](https://osba.sh/). In particular, this example uses the connection strings exposed by the
CosmosDB instance to configure the `bitnami/node` Helm Chart to connect to CosmosDB, instead of
creating and connecting to an in-cluster MongoDB instance.

In `index.ts`, we see the MongoDB-flavored CosmosDB resource definition:

```javascript
// Create a MongoDB-flavored instance of CosmosDB.
const cosmosdb = new azure.cosmosdb.Account("cosmosDb", {
    kind: "MongoDB",
    resourceGroupName: config.resourceGroup.name,
    location: config.location,
    consistencyPolicy: { ... },
    offerType: "Standard",
    enableAutomaticFailover: true,
    geoLocations: [ ... ]
});
```

And then subsequently, in the same file, we see that we use this CosmosDB object to create a
Kubernetes `Secret` containing the connection credentials, which is then consumed by the
`bitnami/node` Helm chart to connect.

```javascript
// Create secret from MongoDB connection string.
const mongoConnStrings = new k8s.core.v1.Secret(
    "mongo-secrets",
    {
        metadata: { name: "mongo-secrets" },
        data: mongoHelpers.parseConnString(cosmosdb.connectionStrings)
    },
    { provider: k8sProvider }
);

// Boot up nodejs Helm chart example using CosmosDB in place of in-cluster MongoDB.
const node = new k8s.helm.v2.Chart(
    "node",
    {
        repo: "bitnami",
        chart: "node",
        version: "4.0.1",
        values: {
            serviceType: "LoadBalancer",
            mongodb: { install: false },
            externaldb: { ssl: true, secretName: "mongo-secrets" }
        }
    },
    { providers: { kubernetes: k8sProvider }, dependsOn: mongoConnStrings }
);
```
