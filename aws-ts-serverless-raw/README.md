# serverless-raw

This example deploys a complete serverless C# application using raw `aws.apigateway.RestAPI`, `aws.lambda.Function` and
`aws.dynamodb.Table` resources from `@pulumi/aws`.  Although this doesn't feature any of the higher-level abstractions
from the `@pulumi/cloud` package, it demonstrates that you can program the raw resources directly available in AWS
to accomplish all of the same things this higher-level package offers.

The deployed Lambda function is a simple C# application, highlighting the ability to manage existing application code
in a Pulumi application, even if your Pulumi code is written in a different language like JavaScript or Python.

The Lambda function is a C# application using dotnet2.0 (a similar approach works for any other language supported by
AWS Lambda).  To deploy the complete application:

```bash
# Create and configure a new stack
$ pulumi stack init testing
$ pulumi config set aws:region us-east-2

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Build the C# app
$ cd ./app
$ dotnet publish
$ cd ..

# Preview and run the deployment
$ pulumi up
