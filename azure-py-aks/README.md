# Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Cluster

This example deploys an AKS cluster, a virtual network, and an Azure Container Registry and grants AKS permissions to access and manage those.

## Deploying the App

To deploy your infrastructure, follow the below steps.

### Prerequisites

1. [Install Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/)
2. [Install Python 3.6 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
3. [Configure Azure Credentials](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/cloud-providers/azure/setup/)
4. [Generate SSH Key](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Generating-Your-SSH-Public-Key)

### Steps

After cloning this repo, from this working directory, run these commands:

1. Create a new stack, which is an isolated deployment target for this example:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi stack init
    ```

1. Create a Python virtualenv, activate it, and install dependencies:

    This installs the dependent packages [needed](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/how-pulumi-works/) for our Pulumi program.

    ```bash
    $ python3 -m venv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

1. Set the configuration variables for this program:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi config set password service_principal_password
    $ pulumi config set sshkey < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    $ # set the azure location in which to run the test
    $ pulumi config set azure:location westus2
    ```

1. Stand up the AKS cluster:

    > **Note**: Due to an [issue](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-azuread/issues/156) in Azure Terraform Provider, the
    > creation of an Azure Service Principal, which is needed to create the Kubernetes cluster, is delayed and may not
    > be available when the cluster is created.  If you get a "Service Principal not found" error, as a work around, you should be able to run `pulumi up`
    > again, at which time the Service Principal replication should have been completed. See [this issue](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/1206) and
    > [this doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/troubleshooting#im-receiving-errors-that-my-service-principal-was-not-found-when-i-try-to-create-a-new-cluster-without-passing-in-an-existing-one)
    > for further details.

    ```bash
    $ pulumi up
    ```

1. After 10-15 minutes, your cluster will be ready, and the kubeconfig YAML you'll use to connect to the cluster will be available as an output. You can save this kubeconfig to a file like so:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi stack output kubeconfig > kubeconfig.yaml
    ```

    Once you have this file in hand, you can interact with your new cluster as usual via `kubectl`:

    ```bash
    $ KUBECONFIG=./kubeconfig.yaml kubectl get nodes
    ```
1. From there, feel free to experiment. Simply making edits and running `pulumi up` will incrementally update your stack.

1. Once you've finished experimenting, tear down your stack's resources by destroying and removing it:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi destroy --yes
    $ pulumi stack rm --yes
    ```
