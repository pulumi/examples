# Google Cloud Functions in Python deployed with C#

This example deploys a Google Cloud Function implemented in Python. Pulumi program is implemented in C#.

## Deploying the App

To deploy your infrastructure, follow the below steps.

### Prerequisites

1. [Install Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/)
1. [Configure Pulumi for GCP](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/cloud-providers/gcp/setup/)
1. [Install .NET Core 3.0+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

## Deploying and running the program

1.  Create a new stack:

    ```
    $ pulumi stack init dev
    ```

1.  Set the GCP project and region:

    ```
    $ pulumi config set gcp:project <your-gcp-project>
    $ pulumi config set gcp:region <gcp-region>
    ```

1.  Run `pulumi up` to preview and deploy changes:

    ```
    $ pulumi up
    Previewing changes:
    ...

    Performing changes:
    ...
    info: 10 changes performed:
        + 10 resources created
    Update duration: 45s
    ```

1.  Check the deployed function endpoints:

    ```
    $ pulumi stack output pythonEndpoint
    https://us-central1-test-1234.cloudfunctions.net/python-func-742a512
    $ curl "$(pulumi stack output pythonEndpoint)"
    Hello World!
    ```
1. From there, feel free to experiment. Simply making edits and running `pulumi up` will incrementally update your stack.

1. Once you've finished experimenting, tear down your stack's resources by destroying and removing it:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi destroy --yes
    $ pulumi stack rm --yes
    ```
