# Host a Static Website on Amazon S3 with the AWS Native Provider

A static website that uses [S3's website support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html).
For a detailed walkthrough of this example, see the tutorial [Static Website on AWS S3](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/tutorials/aws/s3-website/).

Note: Some resources are not yet supported by the Native AWS provider, so we are using both the Native
and Classic provider in this example. The resources will be updated to use native resources as they are
available in AWS's Cloud Control API.

## Deploying and running the program

Note: some values in this example will be different from run to run.  These values are indicated
with `***`.

1.  Install required plugins:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi plugin install resource aws 4.37.3
    $ pulumi plugin install resource aws-native 0.11.0
    ```

1.  Create a new stack:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi stack init dev
    ```

1.  Set the AWS region:

    Either using an environment variable
    ```bash
    $ export AWS_REGION=us-west-2
    ```

    Or with the stack config
    ```bash
    $ pulumi config set aws:region us-west-2
    $ pulumi config set aws-native:region us-west-2
    ```

1.  Run `pulumi up` to preview and deploy changes.  After the preview is shown you will be
    prompted if you want to continue or not.

    ```bash
    $ pulumi up
    Previewing update (dev)
    ...

    Updating (dev)

    View Live: https://app.pulumi.com/***/aws-native-ts-s3-folder/dev/updates/1

         Type                     Name                         Status
    +   pulumi:pulumi:Stack      aws-native-ts-s3-folder-dev  created
    +   ├─ aws-native:s3:Bucket  s3-website-bucket            created
    +   ├─ aws:s3:BucketPolicy   bucketPolicy                 created
    +   ├─ aws:s3:BucketObject   index.html                   created
    +   └─ aws:s3:BucketObject   favicon.png                  created

    Outputs:
    bucketName: "***"
    websiteUrl: "http://***.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com"

    Resources:
    + 5 created

    Duration: ***
    ```

1.  To see the resources that were created, run `pulumi stack output`:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi stack output
    Current stack outputs (2):
    OUTPUT      VALUE
    bucketName  ***
    websiteUrl  http://***.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com
    ```

1.  To see that the S3 objects exist, you can either use the AWS Console or the AWS CLI:

    ```bash
    $ aws s3 ls $(pulumi stack output bucketName)
    2021-09-30 15:27:58      13731 favicon.png
    2021-09-30 15:27:58        198 index.html
    ```

1.  Open the site URL in a browser to see both the rendered HTML and the favicon:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi stack output websiteUrl
    ***.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com
    ```

1.  To clean up resources, run `pulumi destroy` and answer the confirmation question at the prompt.
