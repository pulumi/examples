# Azure App Service with SQL Database and Application Insights

Starting point for building web application hosted in Azure App Service.

Provisions Azure SQL Database and Azure Application Insights to be used in combination
with App Service.

## Deploying the App

To deploy your infrastructure, follow the below steps.

### Prerequisites

1. [Install Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/)
2. [Install .NET Core 3.0+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

### Steps

1. Create a new stack:

    ```bash
    pulumi stack init dev
    ```

1. Login to Azure CLI (you will be prompted to do this during deployment if you forget this step):

    ```bash
    az login
    ```

1. Configure the location to deploy the resources to:

    ```bash
    pulumi config set azure:location <location>
    pulumi config set azure:subscriptionId <YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID>
    ```

1. Define SQL Server password (make it complex enough to satisfy Azure policy):

    ```bash
    pulumi config set --secret sqlPassword <value>
    ```

1. Run `pulumi up` to preview and deploy changes:

    ```console
    $ pulumi up
    Previewing changes:
    ...

    Performing changes:
    ...
    info: 10 changes performed:
        + 10 resources created
    Update duration: 1m14.59910109s
    ```

1. Check the deployed website endpoint:

    ```console
    $ pulumi stack output endpoint
    https://azpulumi-as0ef47193.azurewebsites.net
    $ curl "$(pulumi stack output endpoint)"
    <html>
        <body>
            <h1>Greetings from Azure App Service!</h1>
        </body>
    </html>
    ```

1. From there, feel free to experiment. Simply making edits and running `pulumi up` will incrementally update your stack.

1. Once you've finished experimenting, tear down your stack's resources by destroying and removing it:

    ```bash
    pulumi destroy --yes
    pulumi stack rm --yes
    ```
