# AWS Console Change Slack Notifier in Go

This example deploys a Lambda function and relevant CloudTrail and CloudWatch resources to send a
Slack notification for any resource operation that is performed via the AWS Console.

Note: This application sets up the necessary infrastructure across _each_ AWS region in your
account that is `opt-in-not-required` or `opted-in`. The Pulumi application uses the
[DescribeRegions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeRegions.html) API
via [aws-sdk-go](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go) to query for available regions.

## Deploying the App

 To deploy your infrastructure, follow the below steps.

### Prerequisites

1. [Install Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/)
1. [Configure AWS Credentials](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/cloud-providers/aws/setup/)

### Steps

After cloning this repo, run these commands from the working directory:

1. Build the handler:

	- For developers on Linux and macOS:

		```bash
		make
		```

	- For developers on Windows:

		- Get the `build-lambda-zip` tool:

			```bash
			set GO111MODULE=on
			go.exe get -u github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/cmd/build-lambda-zip
			```

		- Use the tool from your GOPATH:

			```bash
			set GOOS=linux
			set GOARCH=amd64
			set CGO_ENABLED=0
			go build -o handler\dist\handler handler\handler.go
			%USERPROFILE%\Go\bin\build-lambda-zip.exe -o handler\dist\handler.zip handler\dist\handler
			```

1. Create a new Pulumi stack, which is an isolated deployment target for this example:

	```bash
	pulumi stack init
	```

1. Set the required configuration variables for this program:

	```bash
	pulumi config set slackWebhookURL 'YOUR_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL'
	```

1. Execute the Pulumi program to create our lambda:

	```bash
	pulumi up
	```

1. Perform a change in the AWS Console and look for a notification in your Slack channel. Note: you
must perform a _write_ such as adding or removing tags from a resource, launching an instance, or
deleting a resource.

1. From there, feel free to experiment. Simply making edits, rebuilding your handler, and running
`pulumi up` will update your lambda. Customize the Slack message username or text with the following
configuration values:

	```bash
	pulumi config set slackMessageUsername 'Console Change Monitor'
	pulumi config set slackMessageText ':warning: Somebody made a change in the console!'
	```

1. Afterwards, destroy your stack and remove it:

	```bash
	pulumi destroy --yes
	pulumi stack rm --yes
	```
