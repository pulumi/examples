# Static website using Azure Blob Storage and CDN

This example configures [Static website hosting in Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website).

In addition to the Storage itself, a CDN is configured to serve files from the Blob container origin. This may be useful if you need to serve files via HTTPS from a custom domain (not shown in the example).

## Prerequisites

1. [Install Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/)
2. [Configure Azure credentials](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/cloud-providers/azure/setup/)
3. [Install .NET](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/languages/dotnet/)

## Deploying the example

1.  Create a new stack:

    ```bash
    pulumi stack init dev
    ```

1.  Log in to the Azure CLI (you will be prompted to do this during deployment if you forget this step):

    ```bash
    az login
    ```

1.  Set the Azure region location to use:

    ```bash
    pulumi config set azure-native:location westus
    ```

1.  Run `pulumi up` to preview and deploy changes:

    ```bash
    pulumi up
    ```

    ```
    Previewing changes:
    ...

    Performing changes:
    ...
    Resources:
        + 9 created
    Duration: 2m52s
    ```

1.  Check the deployed website endpoint:

    ```bash
    pulumi stack output staticEndpoint
    curl "$(pulumi stack output staticEndpoint)"
    ```

    ```

            <h1>This file is served from Blob Storage (courtesy of Pulumi!)</h1>
        </body>
    </html>
    ```

## Cleaning up

Once you are done, you can destroy all of the resources, and the stack:

```bash
pulumi destroy
pulumi stack rm
```
