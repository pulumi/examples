# Google Cloud Network and Instance with ComponentResource

This example uses `pulumi.ComponentResource` as described [here](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/programming-model/#components) 
to create a Google Cloud Network and instance.

The use of `pulumi.ComponentResource` demonstrates how multiple low-level resources 
can be composed into a higher-level, reusable abstraction.

## Prerequisites

1. [Install Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/)
1. [Configure Pulumi for Google Cloud](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/cloud-providers/gcp/setup/)
1. [Configure Pulumi for Python](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/languages/python/)

## Deploying and running the program

1. Create a Python virtualenv, activate it, and install dependencies:

    This installs the dependent packages [needed](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/how-pulumi-works/) for our Pulumi program.


    ```bash
    $ python3 -m venv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

1. Create a new stack:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi stack init
    ```

1. Set the Google Cloud project and region

    ```bash
    $ pulumi config set gcp:project proj-123456
    $ pulumi config set gcp:region us-central1
    ```

1. Run `pulumi up` to preview and deploy the changes:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi up -y
    Previewing update (dev):

        Type                             Name                          Plan
    +   pulumi:pulumi:Stack              gcp-py-network-component-dev  create

    +      ├─ gcp:compute:Firewall       demo-nginx                    create
    +      └─ gcp:compute:Instance       demo-nginx                    create

    Resources:
        + 11 to create

    Updating (dev):

    ```

1. Get the IP address of the newly-created instance from the stack's outputs: 

    ```bash
    $ pulumi stack output public_ip
    13.64.196.146
    ```

1. Check to see that your server is now running:

    ```bash
    $ curl http://$(pulumi stack output public_ip)

1. Destroy the stack:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi destroy -y

    The resources in the stack have been deleted, but the history and configuration associated with the stack are still maintained.
    If you want to remove the stack completely, run 'pulumi stack rm dev'.
    ```
