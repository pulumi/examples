# AWS API Gateway V2 HTTP API Quickstart

Set up a simple HTTP API using AWS API Gateway V2. The API executes a simple Lambda function 
found in `/app/index.js`.

## Prerequisites
1.  Install [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/).
2.  Configure [Pulumi for AWS](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/cloud-providers/aws/setup/).
3.  Install [Python](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/languages/python).

## Deploying and running the program

Note: some values in this example will be different from run to run.  These values are indicated
with `***`.

1.  Create a new stack:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi stack init http-api
    ```

1.  Set the AWS region:

    ```
    $ pulumi config set aws:region us-east-2
    ```

1.  Run `pulumi up` to preview and deploy changes:

    ```
    $ pulumi up
    Previewing update (http-api)
    ...

    Updating (http-api)

        Type                             Name                                     Status
    +   pulumi:pulumi:Stack              aws-py-apigatewayv2-quickstart-http-api  created
    +   ├─ aws:iam:Role                  lambdaRole                               created
    +   ├─ aws:lambda:Function           lambdaFunction                           created
    +   ├─ aws:iam:RolePolicyAttachment  lambdaRoleAttachment                     created
    +   ├─ aws:apigatewayv2:Api          httpApiGateway                           created
    +   └─ aws:lambda:Permission         lambdapermission                         created

    Outputs:
        endpoint: "https://***.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com"

    Resources:
        + 6 created

    Duration: 22s
    ```
    Note: this command will create a virtual environment and restore dependencies automatically as
    described in [Pulumi docs](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/languages/python/#virtual-environments).

1.  View the endpoint URL and curl a few routes:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi stack output
    Current stack outputs (1):
        OUTPUT            VALUE
        endpoint          https://***.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com

    $ curl $(pulumi stack output endpoint)
    Hello, Pulumi!
    ```

1.  To view the runtime logs of the Lambda function, use the `pulumi logs` command. To get a log stream, use `pulumi logs --follow`.

1.  At this point, you have a running HTTP API. Feel free to modify your program, and run `pulumi up`
to redeploy changes. The Pulumi CLI automatically detects what has changed and makes the minimal 
edits necessary to accomplish these changes. This could be altering the function used by the Lambda,
or anything else you'd like!

## Clean up

1.  Run `pulumi destroy` to tear down all resources.

1.  To delete the stack itself, run `pulumi stack rm`. Note that this command deletes all deployment history from the Pulumi console.
