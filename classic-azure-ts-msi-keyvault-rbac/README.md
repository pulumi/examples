# Managing Secrets and Secure Access in Azure Applications

[Managed identities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/) for Azure resources provides Azure services with an automatically managed identity in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

This example demonstrates using a managed identity with Azure App Service to access Azure KeyVault, Azure Storage, and Azure SQL Database without passwords or secrets.

The application consists of several parts:

- An ASP.NET Application which reads data from a SQL Database and from a file in Blob Storage
- App Service which host the application. The application binaries are placed in Blob Storage, with Blob Url placed as a secret in Azure Key Vault
- App Service has a Managed Identity enabled
- The identify is granted access to the SQL Server, Blob Storage, and Key Vault
- No secret information is placed in App Service configuration: all access rights are derived from Active Directory

## Running the App

1.  Create a new stack:

    ```
    $ pulumi stack init dev
    ```

1.  Login to Azure CLI (you will be prompted to do this during deployment if you forget this step):

    ```
    $ az login
    ```

1.  Restore NPM dependencies:

    ```
    $ npm install
    ```

1.  Build and publish the ASP.NET Core project:

    ```
    $ dotnet publish webapp
    ```

1. Set an appropriate Azure location like:

    ```
    $ pulumi config set azure:location westus
    ```

1.  Run `pulumi up` to preview and deploy changes:

    ```
    $ pulumi up
    Previewing changes:
    ...

    Performing changes:
    ...
    info: 15 changes performed:
        + 15 resources created
    Update duration: 4m16s
    ```

1.  Check the deployed website endpoint:

    ```
    $ pulumi stack output endpoint
    https://app129968b8.azurewebsites.net/
    $ curl "$(pulumi stack output endpoint)"
