# Azure Synapse workspace and pools

Starting point for enterprise analytics solutions based on Azure Synapse. This example creates a Synapse workspace with SQL and Spark pools.

## Prerequisites

1. [Install Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/)
2. [Configure Azure credentials](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/cloud-providers/azure/setup/)
3. [Install Node.js](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/languages/javascript/)

## Deploying the example

1.  Create a new stack:

    ```bash
    pulumi stack init dev
    ```

1.  Log in to the Azure CLI (you will be prompted to do this during deployment if you forget this step):

    ```bash
    az login
    ```

1.  Set the Azure region to deploy into:

    ```bash
    pulumi config set azure-native:location westus2
    ```

1.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

1.  Deploy the stack:

    ```bash
    pulumi up
    ```

    ```
    Previewing changes:
    ...

    Performing changes:
    ...
    Resources:
        + 13 created

    Duration: 10m53s
    ```

1.  Navigate to https://web.azuresynapse.net and sign in to your new workspace.

## Cleaning up

Once you're finished experimenting, tear down your stack's resources by destroying and removing it:

```bash
pulumi destroy
pulumi stack rm
```
