# Kubernetes Guestbook (with Components)

A version of the [Kubernetes Guestbook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateless-application/guestbook/)
application using Pulumi. Unlike [the direct port of the original YAML](../simple), this variant
leverages real code to eliminate boilerplate. A `ServiceDeployment` class is used that combines the common pattern
of deploying a container image using a Kubernetes `Deployment`, and then scaling it using a `Service`.

## Running the App

Follow the steps in [Pulumi Installation](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/) and [Kubernetes Setup](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/cloud-providers/kubernetes/setup/) to get Pulumi working with Kubernetes.

Create a new stack:

```sh
$ pulumi stack init
Enter a stack name: testbook
```

This example will attempt to expose the Guestbook application to the Internet with a `Service` of
type `LoadBalancer`. Since minikube does not support `LoadBalancer`, the Guestbook application
already knows to use type `ClusterIP` instead; all you need to do is to tell it whether you're
deploying to minikube:

```sh
pulumi config set isMinikube <value>
```

Perform the deployment:

```sh
$ pulumi up
Updating (kubernetes-go-guestbook):

Outputs:
    frontend_ip: "10.96.243.48"

Resources:
    + 10 created
```

And finally - open the application in your browser to see the running application. If you're running
macOS you can simply run:

```sh
open $(pulumi stack output frontendIP)
```

> _Note_: minikube does not support type `LoadBalancer`; if you are deploying to minikube, make sure
> to run `kubectl port-forward svc/frontend 8080:80` to forward the cluster port to the local
> machine and access the service via `localhost:8080`.
