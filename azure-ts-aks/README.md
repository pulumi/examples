# Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Cluster using the native Azure Provider

This example deploys an AKS cluster, creates an Azure Active AD application, creates a Service Principal and sets credentials to manage access to the cluster.

## Deploying the App

To deploy your infrastructure, follow the below steps.

### Prerequisites

1. [Install Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/)
2. [Install node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
3. [Configure Azure Credentials](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/cloud-providers/azure/setup/)

### Steps

After cloning this repo, from this working directory, run these commands:

1. Create a new stack, which is an isolated deployment target for this example:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi stack init dev
    ```

1. Next, install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    $ npm install
    ```

1. Set the Azure region location to use:
    
    ```
    $ pulumi config set azure-native:location westus2
    ```

1. Stand up the cluster by invoking pulumi
    ```bash
    $ pulumi up
    ```

1. After 3-4 minutes, your cluster will be ready, and the kubeconfig YAML you'll use to connect to the cluster will be available as an output. You can save this kubeconfig to a file like so:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi stack output kubeconfig --show-secrets > kubeconfig.yaml
    ```

    Once you have this file in hand, you can interact with your new cluster as usual via `kubectl`:

    ```bash
    $ KUBECONFIG=./kubeconfig.yaml kubectl get nodes
    ```

1. From there, feel free to experiment. Simply making edits and running `pulumi up` will incrementally update your stack.

1. Once you've finished experimenting, tear down your stack's resources by destroying and removing it:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi destroy --yes
    $ pulumi stack rm --yes
    ```
