# GraphQL Endpoint in AWS AppSync (in Go)

This example shows how to setup a basic GraphQL endpoint in AWS AppSync. The endpoint contains one query and one mutation that get and put items to a Dynamo DB table.

## Deploying the App

To deploy your infrastructure, follow the below steps.

### Prerequisites

1. [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
2. [Install Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/)
3. [Configure AWS Credentials](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/cloud-providers/aws/setup/)

### Steps

After cloning this repo, from this working directory, run these commands:

1. Create a new Pulumi stack, which is an isolated deployment target for this example:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi stack init dev
    ```

2. Set the required configuration variables for this program (AWS Region):

    ```bash
    $ pulumi config set aws:region us-west-2
    ```

3. Run `pulumi up` up to preview and deploy changes:
    ```bash
    $ pulumi up
    Previewing update (dev):
    ...

    Updating (dev):
    ...
    Resources:
        + 10 created
    Duration: 20s
    ```

4. Check the deployed GraphQL endpoint:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi stack output endpoint
    https://***.appsync-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/graphql
    $ pulumi stack output key
    ***sensitivekey***
    $ curl -XPOST -H "Content-Type:application/graphql" -H "x-api-key:$(pulumi stack output key)" -d '{ "query": "mutation AddTenant { addTenant(id: \"123\", name: \"FirstCorp\") { id name } }" }' "$(pulumi stack output endpoint)" 
    {
        "data": {
            "addTenant": {
                "id": "123",
                "name": "FirstCorp"
            }
        }
    }
    ```

## Clean up

1. Run `pulumi destroy` to tear down all resources.

2. To delete the stack itself, run `pulumi stack rm`. Note that this command deletes all deployment history from the Pulumi console.
