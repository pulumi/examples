# ECS Anywhere

This example from our [ECS Anywhere launchblog post](https://pulumi.com/blog/ecs-anywhere-launch/) shows how to deploy an ECS cluster along with a dockerized app to Digital Ocean.

To do this, we use Pulumi infrastructure as code to provision an
[Elastic Container Service (ECS)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) cluster, build our `Dockerfile` and deploy the
resulting image to a private [Elastic Container Registry (ECR)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) repository, and then create
a set of DigitalOcean droplets behind a load balancer to allow for zero downtime updates.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Download and install the Pulumi CLI](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/)
- [Connect Pulumi with your AWS account](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/cloud-providers/aws/setup/) (if your AWS CLI is configured, no further changes are required)
- [Connect Pulumi with your DigitalOcean account](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/cloud-providers/digitalocean/setup/)

## Running the Example

After cloning this repo, `cd` into it and run these commands:

1. Create a new stack, which is an isolated deployment target for this example:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi stack init dev
    ```

2. Set your desired AWS region:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi config set aws:region us-east-1 # any valid AWS region will work
    ```

3. Deploy everything with a single `pulumi up` command. This will show you a preview of changes first, which
   includes all of the required AWS resources (clusters, services, and the like). Don't worry if it's more than
   you expected -- this is one of the benefits of Pulumi, it configures everything so that so you don't need to!

    ```bash
    $ pulumi up
    ```

    After being prompted and selecting "yes", your deployment will begin. It'll complete in a few minutes:

    ```

4. At this point, your app is running! The URL was published so it's easy to interact with:

    ```bash
    $ curl http://$(pulumi stack output ip)
    Hello World from Pulumi
    ```

5. Once you are done, there is an additional step before running the usual pulumi destroy. This is because the nodes are registered to AWS Systems Manager and the ECS cluster as part of the node setup and happen outside of the Pulumi stack. Run the following in your command line (you’ll need to install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) for this to work):

    ```bash
    $ aws ssm describe-instance-information | jq ".InstanceInformationList | .[] | .InstanceId" | grep "mi-" | xargs -L 1 aws ssm deregister-managed-instance --instance-id

    $ aws ecs list-container-instances --cluster ${pulumi stack output clusterName} | jq ".containerInstanceArns | .[]" | xargs -L 1 aws ecs deregister-container-instance --cluster ${pulumi stack output clusterName} --force --container-instance

    $ pulumi refresh -y
    $ pulumi destroy
    $ pulumi stack rm
    ```
