# Web Server Using Azure Virtual Machine

This example deploys an Azure Virtual Machine and starts an HTTP server on it.

## Prerequisites

1. [Install Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/)
1. [Configure Pulumi for Azure](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/cloud-providers/azure/setup/)
1. [Configure Pulumi for Python](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/languages/python/)

## Deploying and running the program

1. Create a new stack:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi stack init dev
    ```

1. Set the required configuration for this example. This example requires you to supply a username and password to the virtual machine that we are going to create.

    ```
    $ pulumi config set azure-native:location westus    # any valid Azure region will do
    $ pulumi config set username webmaster
    $ pulumi config set password --secret <your-password> 
    ```

    Note that `--secret` ensures your password is encrypted safely.


1. Run `pulumi up` to preview and deploy the changes:

    ```
    $ pulumi update
    Previewing update (azuredev):

        Type                                      Name                         Plan       
    +   pulumi:pulumi:Stack                       azure-py-webserver-azuredev  create     
    +   ├─ azure-native:core:ResourceGroup        server                       create     
    +   ├─ azure-native:network:VirtualNetwork    server-network               create     
    +   ├─ azure-native:network:PublicIp          server-ip                    create

    +   └─ azure-native:compute:VirtualMachine    server-vm                    create

    Updating (azuredev):

        Type                                      Name                         Status

    +   └─ azure-native:compute:VirtualMachine    server-vm                    created

    ```

1. Get the IP address of the newly-created instance from the stack's outputs: 

    ```bash
    $ pulumi stack output public_ip
    137.117.15.111
    ```

1. Check to see that your server is now running:

    ```
    $ curl http://$(pulumi stack output public_ip)
    Hello, World!
    ```

1. Destroy the stack:

    ```bash
    ▶ pulumi destroy --yes
